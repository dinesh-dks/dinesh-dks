- # DATA DRIVEN INNOVATIONS IN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT WITH QLIK INSIGHTS.
- ## Project Description: Managing the flow of goods is hard and takes a long time. It is tough to track everything, especially if it's all in a table. This makes it what is not working and what to fix. But my analysis can make it easier to see the most important goals and how well they are doing. This project helps in making the supply chain team's job easier, find useful ideas to use, and understand how a company's supply chain works
